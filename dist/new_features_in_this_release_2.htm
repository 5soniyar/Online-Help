<p class="p_BodyText"><span class="f_BodyText">Following are key features provided by Intel® Enterprise Edition for Lustre* software and Intel® Manger for Lustre* software.</span></p>
<p class="p_BodyText"><span class="f_BodyText" style="font-weight: bold;">GUI-based creation and management of Lustre* file systems</span></p>
<p class="p_BodyText"><span class="f_BodyText">The Intel® Manager for Lustre* software provides a powerful, yet easy-to-use GUI that enables rapid creation of Lustre file systems. The GUI supports easy configuration for high availability and expansion, and enables performance monitoring and management of multiple Lustre file systems. See <a href="creating_a_file_system2.htm" class="topiclink">Creating a new Lustre* file system</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p_BodyText"><span class="f_BodyText" style="font-weight: bold;">Graphical charts display real-time performance metrics</span></p>
<p class="p_BodyText"><span class="f_BodyText">Fully-configurable color charts display a variety of real-time performance metrics for single or multiple file systems, down to individual servers and targets, and reveal metrics such as read/write heat maps, OST balance, file system capacity, metadata operations, read/write operations, job statistics, and various resource usage parameters, among others. See <a href="view_charts.htm" class="topiclink">View charts on the Dashboard</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p_BodyText"><span class="f_BodyText" style="font-weight: bold;">Auto-configured high-availability clustering for server pairs</span></p>
<p class="p_BodyText"><span class="f_BodyText">Pacemaker and Corosync are configured automatically when the system design follows configuration guidance. This removes the need for manually installing HA configuration files on storage servers, and simplifies high-availability configuration. See <a href="ha_and_failover_support_provid_2.htm" class="topiclink">High-availability file system support</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p_BodyText"><span class="f_BodyText" style="font-weight: bold;">PDU configuration and server outlet assignments support automatic failover</span></p>
<p class="p_BodyText"><span class="f_BodyText">The PDU window lets you configure and manager power distribution units. At this window you can add a detected PDU and assign specific PDU outlets to specific servers. When you associate PDU failover outlets with servers using this tool, STONITH is automatically configured. </span></p>
<p class="p_BodyText"><span class="f_BodyText" style="font-weight: bold;">IPMI and BMC Configuration</span></p>
<p class="p_BodyText"><span class="f_BodyText">An alternative to PDU configuration, support for Intelligent Platform Management Interface and baseboard management controllers support server monitoring, high-availability configuration, and failover. </span></p>
<p class="p_BodyText"><span class="f_BodyText" style="font-weight: bold;">Support for Intel® Xeon Phi™ Coprocessor Clients</span></p>
<p class="p_BodyText"><span class="f_BodyText">Intel® EE for Lustre* client software can be installed and configured to run on Intel® Xeon Phi™ Coprocessor clients. This means that the Intel® Xeon Phi™ Coprocessor clients can directly mount Lustre.</span></p>
<p class="p_BodyText"><span class="f_BodyText" style="font-weight: bold;">Hierarchical Storage Management</span></p>
<p class="p_BodyText"><span class="f_BodyText">Intel® EE for Lustre* software includes support for hierarchical storage management. HSM provides a way to free up file system storage capacity by archiving the less-frequently accessed files into secondary, archival storage. You can configure the HSM framework directly from the Intel® Manager for Lustre* GUI.</span></p>
<p class="p_BodyText"><span class="f_BodyText" style="font-weight: bold;">Distributed Name Space</span></p>
<p class="p_BodyText"><span class="f_BodyText">Distributed Namespace (DNE) allows the Lustre metadata to be distributed across multiple servers. DNE1 has been incorporated into Intel® EE for Lustre* software, and this featured is supported at the Intel® Manager for Lustre* GUI. </span></p>
<p class="p_BodyText"><span class="f_BodyText" style="font-weight: bold;">Robinhood Policy Engine</span></p>
<p class="p_BodyText"><span class="f_BodyText">The Robinhood policy engine has been incorporated into Lustre and is included with Intel® EE for Lustre*. Intel® Manager for Lustre* software performs the provisioning of the Robinhood agent server, which is performed via the manager GUI. Robinhood can be used with the HSM capabilities described above to automate HSM archiving and report generation. </span></p>
<p class="p_BodyText"><span class="f_BodyText" style="font-weight: bold;">Apache Hadoop* adapter software</span></p>
<p class="p_BodyText"><span class="f_BodyText">Intel® EE for Lustre* software is supported by the Apache Hadoop* adapter software, however the adapter software is a separate download. This Hadoop adapter for Lustre is compatible with the Apache Hadoop software, versions 2.3 and 2.5 as of this writing. &nbsp;Hadoop software allows users who run MapReduce jobs to bypass storing data in HDFS, and store the MapReduce output directly to Lustre instead. This allows the analytical processes direct access to scientific output instead of transferring data from the compute cluster storage system to another file system. Optimizations have also been made to the shuffle step in MapReduce to take advantage of Lustre’s high-speed network access to data. Many workloads will see an overall reduction in end-to-end processing time by using the Hadoop adapter with the Intel® EE for Lustre* software file system. &nbsp;For more information, see Installing Hadoop, the Hadoop Adapter for Intel® EE for Lustre* Software, and the Job Scheduler Integration.</span></p>
<p class="p_BodyText"><span class="f_BodyText" style="font-weight: bold;">Automated Provisioning of Custom Lustre Service Nodes</span></p>
<p class="p_BodyText"><span class="f_BodyText">This feature allows users to create custom profiles for new Lustre client types and, based on a given profile, deploy and install custom code to provide new services. HSM copytool (above) is deployed in this way. Other services might include Samba file services, etc.</span></p>
<p class="p_BodyText"><span class="f_BodyText" style="font-weight: bold;">Simplified ISO-less installation and automated deployment mechanism streamlines overall installation</span></p>
<p class="p_BodyText"><span class="f_BodyText">The installation strategy removes the need to manually install the software on each server. Intel® Manager for Lustre* software is quickly installed on the manager server, and from there, required packages are automatically deployed to all storage servers. Storage servers and the manager server can run the same standard operating system as the rest of your estate. Additional software built for CentOS or Red Hat will also work on servers managed by Intel® Manager for Lustre* software.</span></p>
<p class="p_BodyText"><span class="f_BodyText" style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span><span class="f_BodyText">: The </span><span class="f_BodyText" style="font-style: italic;">manager server</span><span class="f_BodyText"> is that server where the Intel® Manager for Lustre* software dashboard is installed.</span></p>
<p class="p_BodyText"><span class="f_BodyText" style="font-weight: bold;">Support for OpenZFS in Management Mode</span></p>
<p class="p_BodyText"><span class="f_BodyText">Intel® EE for Lustre* software supports ZFS as a back-end file system replacement for ldiskfs. &nbsp;Intel® Manager for Lustre* software is able to configure and manage high-availability Lustre storage solutions, and Intel® EE for Lustre* software can discover and manage ZFS file systems. See <a href="creating_and_managing_of_zfs-b.htm" class="topiclink">Creating and Managing ZFS-based Lustre file systems</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p_BodyText"><span class="f_BodyText" style="font-weight: bold;">Intel® EE for Lustre* Software ZFS Snapshots</span></p>
<p class="p_BodyText"><span class="f_BodyText">The OpenZFS file system provides integrated support for snapshots, a data protection feature that enables an operator to checkpoint a file system volume. &nbsp;In Intel® EE for Lustre* software, as of version 3.0.0.0, Intel® has developed a mechanism in Lustre* that leverages ZFS to take a coordinated snapshot of an entire Lustre* file system, if all of the storage targets in the file system are formatted using ZFS.</span></p>
<p class="p_BodyText"><span class="f_BodyText" style="font-weight: bold;">HPC Job Scheduler integration with MapReduce </span></p>
<p class="p_BodyText"><span class="f_BodyText">Intel® EE for Lustre* software works with the HPC job scheduler integration with MapReduce; however the job scheduler integration is a separate download. The HPC job scheduler integration supports Apache Hadoop. This adapter for job schedulers allows you to integrate common resource schedulers into your cluster. You have the choice of installing the SLURM (Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management) job scheduler integration or the PBS (portable batch system) job scheduler integration. &nbsp;An integration guide is available: Installing Hadoop, the Hadoop Adapter for Intel® EE for Lustre* Software, and the Job Scheduler Integration.</span></p>
<p class="p_BodyText"><span class="f_BodyText">Hadoop commonly uses Yarn to manage MapReduce jobs. However, virtually all HPC systems use a job scheduler, for example, SLURM, but having two job schedulers, e.g., SLURM and Yarn, in a single system can cause problems. The HPC Job Scheduler integration with MapReduce replaces YARN with an interface to the main resource manager for the system. This allows MapReduce applications to be run as normal HPC jobs. </span></p>
<p class="p_BodyText"><span class="f_BodyText" style="font-weight: bold;">Apache Hive compatibility</span></p>
<p class="p_BodyText"><span class="f_BodyText">Hive is a data warehouse infrastructure built on top of Hadoop for providing data summarization, query, and analysis. Intel® has tested the Hadoop adapter for Lustre provided with Intel® EE for Lustre* software for compatibility with Apache Hive version 2.5.</span></p>
<p class="p_BodyText"><span class="f_BodyText" style="font-weight: bold;">Apache Hbase compatibility</span></p>
<p class="p_BodyText"><span class="f_BodyText">HBase is a non-relational, distributed database modeled after Google's BigTable and written in Java*. &nbsp;Hbase runs on top of HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System). Intel® has tested the Hadoop adapter for Lustre provided with Intel® EE for Lustre* software for compatibility with Apache Hbase version 2.5.</span></p>
<p class="p_BodyText"><span class="f_BodyText" style="font-weight: bold;">Lustre 2.7.x</span></p>
<p class="p_BodyText"><span class="f_BodyText">This release of Intel® EE for Lustre* software is based on the Intel® Foundation Edition for Lustre* 2.7 release tree, representing a major update to the underlying Lustre* version for the Intel® Enterprise Edition for Lustre* software (as of version 3.0.0.0).</span></p>
<p class="p_BodyText"><span class="f_BodyText" style="font-weight: bold;">Online Lustre File System Consistency Checks (LFSCK)</span></p>
<p class="p_BodyText"><span class="f_BodyText">LFSCK is an administrative tool that was first introduced in Lustre* software release 2.3 for checking and repairing attributes specific to a mounted Lustre* file system. LFSCK is similar in concept to an offline FSCK repair tool for a local file system, but LFSCK is implemented to run as part of the Lustre* file system while the file system is mounted and in use. LFSCK allows consistency checking and repair by the Lustre software without downtime, and can be run on the largest Lustre* file systems with negligible disruption to normal operations.</span></p>
<p class="p_BodyText"><span class="f_BodyText" style="font-weight: bold;">Distributed Namespace </span></p>
<p class="p_BodyText"><span class="f_BodyText">Distributed Namespace (DNE) allows the Lustre metadata to be distributed across multiple metadata servers. &nbsp;Intel® EE for Lustre* software supports DNE1 (as of release 2.3.0.0), which supports the use of multiple MDTs. This enables the size of the Lustre namespace and metadata throughput to be scaled with the number of OSSs. This featured is supported at the Intel® Manager for Lustre* GUI.</span></p>
<p class="p_BodyText"><span class="f_BodyText" style="font-weight: bold;">DNE II Striped Directories Support (Preview)</span></p>
<p class="p_BodyText"><span class="f_BodyText">Striped directories support (Distributed Name Space, phase 2) is available in Intel® EE for Lustre* software, as of version 3.0, as a technology preview. Striped directories allow operators to shard directory entries across multiple metadata storage targets, providing both namespace and metadata performance scalability.</span></p>
<p class="p_BodyText"><span class="f_BodyText" style="font-weight: bold;">Single Client Metadata Concurrency</span></p>
<p class="p_BodyText"><span class="f_BodyText">Also referred to as “multi-slot last_rcvd”, this update to the metadata communications interface between client and server allows multiple metadata RPCs to be in flight in parallel, per-client for both read and write transactions. Prior to this release, any client RPCs that modified file system metadata (for example, creates or unlinks), were sent serially to the server. With this update, this restriction is removed.</span></p>
<p class="p_BodyText"><span class="f_BodyText" style="font-weight: bold;">Differentiated Storage Services</span></p>
<p class="p_BodyText"><span class="f_BodyText">Differentiated Storage Services (DSS) allows I/O data to be classified, sometimes referred to as “hinting&quot;. These hints pass seamlessly through Intel® EE Edition for Lustre* software, at which point data can be tiered and intelligently cached by the storage system. This enables a more efficient use of cache space, and decreases the likelihood of critical data being evicted when the cache fills. Intel® is working directly with storage and cache vendors to enable DSS hinting in Lustre appliances, and to provide optimized performance to Intel® EE Edition for Lustre* software deployments with a mix of SSD and traditional storage.</span></p>
<p class="p_BodyText"><span class="f_BodyText" style="font-weight: bold;">Support for Intel® Omni-Path Architecture</span><span class="f_BodyText"> </span></p>
<p class="p_BodyText"><span class="f_BodyText">Intel® Omni-Path fabric support is available for Intel® EE for Lustre* software systems running RHEL 7.3. &nbsp;(Intel® OPA driver support requires RHEL 7.1 or newer, and so is not available for RHEL 6.x based systems.)</span></p>
<p class="p_BodyText"><span class="f_BodyText" style="font-weight: bold;">LNet Configuration</span></p>
<p class="p_BodyText"><span class="f_BodyText">This feature assists in configuring LNet for a given server’s network interface by setting the LNet network ID for that port. This feature requires a single LNet. You can configure multiple LNets (i.e., with the use of routers), however in this release, additional LNets cannot be configured from the GUI.</span></p>
<p class="p_BodyText"><span class="f_BodyText" style="font-weight: bold;">Dynamic LNet Configuration</span></p>
<p class="p_BodyText"><span class="f_BodyText">Dynamic LNet configuration (DLC) is a powerful extension of the LNet software to simplify system administration tasks for Lustre networking. DLC allows an operator to make changes to LNet (for example, network interfaces can be added and removed, or parameters changed,) without requiring that the kernel modules be removed and reloaded. Parameters can be altered while LNet is still running, meaning that tuning and optimization can be conducted while Lustre* is still running on the target node. &nbsp;Dynamic LNet configuration also applies to LNet routers, so that routes can be added, removed and updated without affecting other Lustre network traffic.</span></p>
<p class="p_BodyText"><span class="f_BodyText" style="font-weight: bold;">Kerberos Network Authentication and Encryption</span></p>
<p class="p_BodyText"><span class="f_BodyText">Kerberos provides a means for authentication and authorization of participants on a computer network, as well as providing secure communications through authentication. This functionality has been applied to Intel® EE for Lustre* software for the purposes of establishing trust between Lustre* servers and clients, and optionally, supporting encrypted network communications.</span></p>
